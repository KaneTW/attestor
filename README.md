# Attestor

Attestor is a [shape analysis][11] tool that attempts to discover precise
invariants about the data structures employed by a Java program.
It is based on various notions of [graph grammars][12] as a formal underpinning.

## Why Shape Analysis?

Many software bugs can be traced back to the erroneous use of pointers,
i.e., references to memory addresses. They constitute an essential
concept in modern programming languages, and are used for implementing
dynamic data structures like lists, trees etc. Due to the resulting
unbounded state spaces, pointer errors are hard to detect in sequential
programs. A shape analysis, such as the one implemented by Attestor, supports
developers twofold:

1. It supports automatic verification of the absence of (certain) pointer-related
   errors.
2. It provides useful debugging information in case errors have been detected.


## System Requirements

The following software has to be installed prior to the installation of Attestor:

- [Java JDK 1.8][3]
- [Apache Maven][4]
- (Windows) Since Attestor uses [soot][13], please make sure that rt.jar is in your CLASSPATH.


## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/moves-rwth/attestor.git
    $ mvn install
  
## Running Attestor

Instructions on running attestor from the command-line can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/moves-rwth/attestor/wiki/Running-Attestor-from-the-command-line).

## Examples and Benchmarks

There is a [separate repository][2] that collects benchmarks and example programs that have been successfully analyzed.
Each benchmark can be executed individually using maven.
Details are provided in the README of the indidividual collection of examples.

## Documentation and Publications

The API document is available as part of this repository [here][1].
